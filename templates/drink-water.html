                    <p>It's um, sometimes what if we drink too much water, water is super cool, drink as much as you wish, wrong gemeinsam. Drinking too much water is not the problem but drinking too much water in a short span of time is oh, we drink water beyond the processing capability of our kidneys then they are not able to eliminate the excess water. As a result, water level increases in our blood and sodium level goes down. This condition is known as hyponatremia or water intoxication. Sodium is an essential electrolyte to which balances fluids inside and outside ourselves. The imbalance caused by water level going up and sodium level going down causes the fluids outside ourselves to move inside. As a result, our cells begin to swell, the swelling can cause multiple health problems. Also, if swelling takes place in our brain cells, then we can get headaches or nausea. This condition can also prove to be fatal. How Much Water Should You Drink Per Day 68.273564981 leaders now, up to 60% of the human adult body is water. But every day we lose some of this water through sweat, urine, etc. So we need to replenish it. Now there's a popular eight by eight rule which says everyday one should drink eight glasses, each containing eight ounces of water. Whereas the Institute of Medicine suggests that the total water intake including all beverages and food should be 2.7 litres for women and 3.7 litres for men. However, no single formula fits everyone. But our amazing body itself tells us when we need water. For example, dark yellow urine is usually a very good sign of dehydration, exercise, climate and conditions like diarrhoea, vomiting, etc can lead to additional water loss, so our body makes us feel more thirsty. This brings us to the conclusion that the water needs vary from person to person and situation to situation. Why is ocean water salty? Several natural processes make ocean water salty. For example, when it rains, the water droplets react with carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and form carbonic acid making rainwater slightly acidic. This acidic rainwater reacts with minerals present in the Rockson forms new minerals and salts. These minerals and salts are then carried by flowing water to the oceans, thus making the ocean water salty.</p>

                    <p> In addition to this, along the mid ocean ridges, magma rises close to the oceanic crust. Here when the salty ocean water seeps into the Earth's crust. It gets hot due to magma. This hot water dissolves more minerals present in the crust and carries them to the oceans through fissures called hydrothermal vents, thus making the ocean water salty. Why is fluoride added to water to make water tastes like soft drink? Now, according to a prevailing study, when fluoride is added to public water supplies at an average concentration of about one part per million or slightly below, it prevents tooth decay. Oh, but how enamel is the hard outer covering of our tooth. It is primarily made up of Hydroxyapatite Hydroxyapatite is a compound of calcium, phosphorus and hydroxide. Now when bacteria in our mouth feed on food particles they produce as this acid dissolves the Hydroxyapatite leaving behind a residue of calcium and phosphate ions. This results in a tooth decay. Now when we drink water containing fluoride, the fluoride binds with calcium and phosphate ions forming lower appetite. As floor appetite is less susceptible to acid attacks it helps to stop the tooth decay process. Topic distillation is distilled water safe to drink Ah, how would I know? Am I a detective? Alright, right all right, I'll answer it. Distilled water is obtained from distillation. In distillation, the impure water is first heated thus converting water to vapour then this vapour is condensed by cooling, hence converting vapour back to liquid water.</p>

                    <p>Hmm by this process, the impurities remained behind giving us pure distilled water Now even though distilled water is pure, some doctors say that we should not drink it for a prolonged period of time. So can I take a bath with it? I haven't bathed since last Sunday. Oh gross, you are just impossible. It is generally recommended to avoid drinking distilled water for a long period because along with the impurities the minerals required for the proper growth of our body are left behind during distillation scopic water purification Hmm Why is alum added to water? Uh huh. Because water does not like to be alone. It wants somebody company now. alum is added to purify water. alum is Allah minium sulphate, it acts as a coagulant. a coagulant attracts and binds with extremely fine in small particles to form a large particle. No, I won't use it. But why? Because it will attract all small insects and make a large insect. Oh, you're just unbelievable. When a solution of alum is added to impure water, it attracts and binds with contaminants and find suspended particles of mud, dirt, etc. To form large particles being large. These particles can be removed by filtration or when they settle down due to gravity. They can be removed through decantation giving us pure water</p>
