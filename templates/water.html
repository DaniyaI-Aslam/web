                    <p>Tick, tock, tick, tock. We've all heard the sound of a clock. Have you ever stopped to think
                        about what it means? There are two fixed points in your life, birth, and death. And what happens
                        in between, that's under your control. It's the only thing under your control. Now, we have no
                        idea what the distance between birth and death is going to be. And you've heard the story. So
                        many times, somebody gets really bad news, they find out they've got life threatening cancer,
                        they've only got a few months to live, they quit their job, sell all their possessions, and go
                        volunteering in a far off country, giving back to other people, spending time with the people
                        important to them, and spending time doing the things that really matter the most. So why is it
                        that we wait for such a massive moment for us to take massive action? What if you could change
                        everything today? What if you could change everything? In an instant right now, watching this
                        video on YouTube, on your phone or your laptop? Or wherever you are? What if change could
                        happen?</p>
                    <center><img src="{% static 'image/mr-bean.gif' %}" alt=""height="300px" width="300px"></center>
                    <p>I don't care how good you don't care how talented you are. I don't care how much you work on
                        yourself. There are some times when things are going to go right. That just I'm not going to go
                        right there are times when anything that can happen will happen. Murphy's Law will be knocking
                        at your door. Wow, I don't know why that's called life. And you have to deal with it. Sometimes
                        your life will be in a slump. Just like sports. Some of the best shooters can hit baskets
                        different times in games, they get in a slump, do they sit on the sidelines, they get adjusted
                        hit a basket today? No, they continue to execute. I suggest to you that if you are facing a
                        challenge, don't stop. stay busy. Work your plan. Continue to do those things that you know that
                        work for you. After you have evaluated yourself in the situation. Continue to move, stay busy,
                        stay busy, stay busy. Repeat out to me help somebody and help yourself. Because what you give is
                        what you get. Find somebody that you can help so you can forget about you for a moment. So
                        sometimes the best thing to do is to be sometimes you have to just back up and go within
                        yourself.</p>
                        
                    <p>And I think there's a simple thing that you need that we hear again and again in these
                        motivational speeches. And it's a simple word. But it's misunderstood. And it's belief. If
                        you're going to really change the first thing that you have to move from an opinion to a belief
                        and a belief into a conviction is that you are the one that can change. You are the one that is
                        responsible for who you are, where you are in life right now. The things that you do, the things
                        that you don't do that you know that you should, the things that you have become the person that
                        you've become, and as a result, the things that you have. And there's all kinds of things going
                        on right now. There's all kinds of thoughts going on right now. There's all kinds of feeling but
                        amidst all of those things amidst the sea of confusion that you might feel, let me ask you a
                        very simple question, a very basic question. Do you believe that you have the power to change?
                        Time is all we have? This moment, right now.</p>
                    <p>There's only one thing in our lives that we're never able to reacquire once it's gone. And I'm
                        not talking about money. I'm not talking about material items. I'm talking about time. And it's
                        such a unique concept, unique idea because when utilised correctly, it contains the ingredients
                        to success, to happiness, to growth, prosperity, all the things we want. But at the very same
                        time if neglected, it leaves us with very little because the truth is every morning when you
                        wake up, you are living minutes you will never get back You were breathing air, you will never
                        take in again, it is your one opportunity to embrace this gift. And every second sees a little
                        love it slip away. And my point is that there is no moment more important, more perfect than
                        right now, not in a week, not after your promotion, not in 30 years, when you plan to retire and
                        relax, right now. See, we have this mentality, that the future is going to somehow mean more
                        than the present, that if we suffer now, or for unhappy now, that will save the best in life for
                        some other time. But the reality is, we don't get younger. Yes, we should be working hard.
                        Absolutely. Success comes from effort, hard work, dedication, persistence, but the key is
                        allocate your precious time to the work to the things that make you feel like today is power.
                        That right now is so amazing, you don't want it to end today is when you take the first step
                        towards the things you want. When you become who you want to become no one is ever or will ever
                        keep you from that other than yourself. There is no ceiling, there is no limitation there is no
                        special requirement there is you and what you allow yourself to accomplish. You are the
                        gatekeeper, you have your foot on the gas pedal. And it's so easy to point to others, right to
                        point to our environment to blame things on everything. But our own decision, our decision to
                        stick to the status quo. Because believe it or not, it is that simple. You are where you are.
                        Because that's where you decided to be. And you've accepted that as okay. Look, if you want
                        change, then manufacture change, create a plan and move, go transform step out of your head and
                        into the real world. Think about how lucky we are to be alive in this day and age with access to
                        all the information we could ever dream of technology that enables growth, freedom to pursue any
                        path that looks appealing, anything we could ever want, is right in front of us, yet we don't
                        embrace Why Why in the world would we let that be? Nothing is more important in life than living
                        in nothing makes us feel more energised, more free, more happy than following the path we were
                        meant to take. It's having the courage to step over the obstacles to face the challenges to be
                        uncomfortable. And at the beginning, it's tough, right? Change is tough. getting what you want
                        isn't easy. There was a period of struggle of growth. But once you get through it, you
                        understand what living really is. Which brings us right back to the concept of time, our small
                        existence on this planet, the greatest gift, a human being can receive you, by default have,
                        don't ever let it be in vain. The future isn't when happiness someday occurs, it's a
                        continuation of you living every moment to the fullest from now, until your last make every trip
                        around the sun better than the previous never let a moment of sunshine clouds or rain deprive
                        you of your gift, be the best version of yourself. You can be live the life you were meant to
                        live. All it takes is a simple decision.</p>
                    <center><img src="{% static 'image/time.gif' %}" alt=""height="300px" width="300px"></center>
                    <p>So when you imagine the change that you want to create in your life, the person that you know you
                        want to be you should be based on the resources and ideas that you have. What is stopping you?
                        What's stopping you from waking up early? What's stopping you from creating good habits? What's
                        stopping you from cutting people out of your life that you know, no longer serve you? That clock
                        is always taking and one day it won't. You'll be met with silence and this journey it will end
                        and that that moment when people look at your gravestone when they come to your funeral. What is
                        it that you want them to remember you for? What kind of impact and legacy Do you want to leave
                        behind through the Lesson that is your life. And are you really living that lesson every single
                        day? Stop waiting for tomorrow, stop waiting for the perfect moment and start now. Start
                        believing, start dreaming and create the life and the person that you really want to see.
                        Because like I said at the beginning tick tock, tick tock</p>

                        yourself. There are some times when things are going to go right. That just I'm not going to go
                        right there are times when anything that can happen will happen. Murphy's Law will be knocking
                        at your door. Wow, I don't know why that's called life. And you have to deal with it. Sometimes
                        your life will be in a slump. Just like sports. Some of the best shooters can hit baskets
                        different times in games, they get in a slump, do they sit on the sidelines, they get adjusted
                        hit a basket today? No, they continue to execute. I suggest to you that if you are facing a
                        challenge, don't stop. stay busy. Work your plan. Continue to do those things that you know that
                        work for you. After you have evaluated yourself in the situation. Continue to move, stay busy,
                        stay busy, stay busy. Repeat out to me help somebody and help yourself. Because what you give is
                        what you get. Find somebody that you can help so you can forget about you for a moment. So
                        sometimes the best thing to do is to be sometimes you have to just back up and go within
                        yourself.</p>
                        
                    <p>And I think there's a simple thing that you need that we hear again and again in these
                        motivational speeches. And it's a simple word. But it's misunderstood. And it's belief. If
                        you're going to really change the first thing that you have to move from an opinion to a belief
                        and a belief into a conviction is that you are the one that can change. You are the one that is
                        responsible for who you are, where you are in life right now. The things that you do, the things
                        that you don't do that you know that you should, the things that you have become the person that
                        you've become, and as a result, the things that you have. And there's all kinds of things going
                        on right now. There's all kinds of thoughts going on right now. There's all kinds of feeling but
                        amidst all of those things amidst the sea of confusion that you might feel, let me ask you a
                        very simple question, a very basic question. Do you believe that you have the power to change?
                        Time is all we have? This moment, right now.</p>
                    <p>There's only one thing in our lives that we're never able to reacquire once it's gone. And I'm
                        not talking about money. I'm not talking about material items. I'm talking about time. And it's
                        such a unique concept, unique idea because when utilised correctly, it contains the ingredients
                        to success, to happiness, to growth, prosperity, all the things we want. But at the very same
                        time if neglected, it leaves us with very little because the truth is every morning when you
                        wake up, you are living minutes you will never get back You were breathing air, you will never
                        take in again, it is your one opportunity to embrace this gift. And every second sees a little
                        love it slip away. And my point is that there is no moment more important, more perfect than
                        right now, not in a week, not after your promotion, not in 30 years, when you plan to retire and
                        relax, right now. See, we have this mentality, that the future is going to somehow mean more
                        than the present, that if we suffer now, or for unhappy now, that will save the best in life for
                        some other time. But the reality is, we don't get younger. Yes, we should be working hard.
                        Absolutely. Success comes from effort, hard work, dedication, persistence, but the key is
                        allocate your precious time to the work to the things that make you feel like today is power.
                        That right now is so amazing, you don't want it to end today is when you take the first step
                        towards the things you want. When you become who you want to become no one is ever or will ever
                        keep you from that other than yourself. There is no ceiling, there is no limitation there is no
                        special requirement there is you and what you allow yourself to accomplish. You are the
                        gatekeeper, you have your foot on the gas pedal. And it's so easy to point to others, right to
                        point to our environment to blame things on everything. But our own decision, our decision to
                        stick to the status quo. Because believe it or not, it is that simple. You are where you are.
                        Because that's where you decided to be. And you've accepted that as okay. Look, if you want
                        change, then manufacture change, create a plan and move, go transform step out of your head and
                        into the real world. Think about how lucky we are to be alive in this day and age with access to
                        all the information we could ever dream of technology that enables growth, freedom to pursue any
                        path that looks appealing, anything we could ever want, is right in front of us, yet we don't
                        embrace Why Why in the world would we let that be? Nothing is more important in life than living
                        in nothing makes us feel more energised, more free, more happy than following the path we were
                        meant to take. It's having the courage to step over the obstacles to face the challenges to be
                        uncomfortable. And at the beginning, it's tough, right? Change is tough. getting what you want
                        isn't easy. There was a period of struggle of growth. But once you get through it, you
                        understand what living really is. Which brings us right back to the concept of time, our small
                        existence on this planet, the greatest gift, a human being can receive you, by default have,
                        don't ever let it be in vain. The future isn't when happiness someday occurs, it's a
                        continuation of you living every moment to the fullest from now, until your last make every trip
                        around the sun better than the previous never let a moment of sunshine clouds or rain deprive
                        you of your gift, be the best version of yourself. You can be live the life you were meant to
                        live. All it takes is a simple decision.</p>
                    <center><img src="{% static 'image/time.gif' %}" alt=""height="250px" width="250px"></center>
                    <p>So when you imagine the change that you want to create in your life, the person that you know you
                        want to be you should be based on the resources and ideas that you have. What is stopping you?
                        What's stopping you from waking up early? What's stopping you from creating good habits? What's
                        stopping you from cutting people out of your life that you know, no longer serve you? That clock
                        is always taking and one day it won't. You'll be met with silence and this journey it will end
                        and that that moment when people look at your gravestone when they come to your funeral. What is
                        it that you want them to remember you for? What kind of impact and legacy Do you want to leave
                        behind through the Lesson that is your life. And are you really living that lesson every single
                        day? Stop waiting for tomorrow, stop waiting for the perfect moment and start now. Start
                        believing, start dreaming and create the life and the person that you really want to see.
                        Because like I said at the beginning tick tock, tick tock</p>
